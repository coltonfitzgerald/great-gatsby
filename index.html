					<p>Nick Callaway talks about the Great War (World War 1) and how much he liked it. This was the only mention of the Great War in Chapter 1 and he doesn’t talk about fighting in it at all. Before the book even starts, the Great War had just ended and the effects were still everlasting within people. There were thoughts of being unsafe commonly throughout the States and some people were even questioning what life meant to them. This was also right before the Great Depression, so manufacturing and making was still at its peak and this caused a mass influx of money for everyone. It was a happy, drunk dream for most people during this time and it shows itself throughout the book as it seems like in almost every scene, alcohol is involved.</p>
					<p>Daisy talks about how she wants her daughter to be a “beautiful fool”. Women did not have many rights and weren’t appreciated very much during the 1920’s and it rubs off in this book. Daisy wants her to be a fool because of how women are treated within society. If she is a beautiful fool, she will be able to marry a man and not have the intelligence to know she doesn’t have many rights, which will make her happy in the long run.</p>
					<p>When Tom mentions “The Rise of the Colored Empires”, it shows the racism that still went on during the 1920’s. Even though African Americans still had freedom, they were not treated with respect and this is a prime example of it. The Harlem Renaissance was going on during this time as African American culture flourished and people like Tom may have actually believed that African Americans would have taken over. The Harlem Renaissance was a cultural takeover in which jazz and other forms of art flourished during this time.</p>

					<b><i>“In consequence I’m inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought—frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon—for the intimate revelations of young men or at least the terms in which they express them are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions.” (Page 3)</i></b>
					<p>Ok, so, this quote (which I’m sure is somewhere near the one everyone picked for this chapter), is fairly difficult to understand at first, but it sure does make a lot of sense. So, in order to look at this quote we have to look before this quote, at his father basically saying “Don’t look down on people because they are poorer/less educated/uglier, etc., than you.” So, when the first sentence starts, Nick is explaining how, because of what his father said to him, he keeps his mouth shut when it comes to judging other people. He then says that this has caused strange or peculiar people (curious natures) to approach him more easily, as they will avoid judgement from him. Another type of person to approach him is the “veteran bore”, someone who is a veteran at being a bore, or boring. Somebody who is really bog-standard and not interesting in the slightest. These people would normally be ridiculed by their colleagues, especially in the roaring 20s. The boring people all worked on Wall Street with other boring people and all the fun people never worked, just partied with other fun people. “The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person,” The wording on this sentence is a little iffy, if you ask me. Abnormal minds would be those that were stated about 6-7 lines above this one, people that are strange and/or boring. These types of people would immediately recognise that Nick is not the judging type, and would then try to stay around him. He also calls himself normal right at the end of that line, which to me seems very acute. Although, normal isn’t really the word to describe Nick. Something like boring would be better suited. A lot of the action in this story is going to happen around Nick without him ever really being involved. He then goes on to say that he was accused of being a politician, because he knew a lot of secrets belonging to men that he didn’t know. These men also seem to be very in the need for secrets, as they are “wild”, and probably have made their fair share of mistakes. A common stereotype of politicians is the one of a scheming manipulator; someone who will pay or kill for dirt on their competitors to give themselves an edge. Most of these secrets were not confided in him willingly, and he did not necessarily want to know them. Nick learned of these secrets through either pretending to be asleep or busy with other things. The last thing he mentions is “hostile levity”. Levity means something along the lines of “to be joking or jovial but in a rude or disrespecting manner, usually in the face of something serious”. To do this with hostility, Nick would have to basically make a rude joke to get people to shut up about their secrets, at which point they would tell him about their secrets anyways. The last line states that the way that all young men tell their secrets is exactly the same. Their movements and speech patterns are plagiarised, or stolen, from others and they have extremely obvious hesitations when telling them to others.</p>

					<p>The main historical reference for this chapter is the activities that happen with women and how women are portrayed. In the 1920’s, women were portrayed in a way that made it so they were more of objects than actual people. Tom Buchanan’s mistress, Myrtle, was never questioned for being an actual mistress and it is odd because today, this kind of act would never be okay.</p>
					<p>Another example of women being treated badly in the 1920’s would be when Tom Buchanan hit Myrtle to the point where she bled. This is abuse and in today’s world is highly looked down upon. Of course it was looked down upon in the book, but clearly not as much as it would have today. This is why women’s rights were so popular at the time, women were not seen as people like today, but they were seen more as objects.</p>
					<p>Alcohol was another reference clearly made in this chapter. There was a lot of drinking that went on and this is a reference to the ending of the Great War. After it ended, people wanted to celebrate more than usual and the ending of the prohibition contributed greatly to this. Alcohol was now freely available and so people were drinking heavily during this time. People were rich in the 20’s, which brought down the value of alcohol, making it more readily available.</p>

					<b><i>“Yet high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening streets, and I was him too, looking up and wondering. I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.” (Page 39-40)</i></b>
					<p>I remember this being one of my favorite quotes from the 1974 rendition of this movie. Or, maybe they didn’t even say it in that movie. It’s been a while since I’ve seen it. This quote comes some time during the party scene, directly after Nick attempts to leave the area, but says that something always pulls him back into his chair, someone always causes him to stay. The party is getting pretty wild, events and members alike. Their light filled windows must have contributed a fair amount of secrecy to people moving below, looking up at the buildings, seeing window after window, some with figures, some without. Behind every window is a vast wealth of story. Inside every room is a platoon of secrets most people will never know. To the common man wandering the street, anything in the universe can be happening in that apartment. “I was him too, looking up and wondering.” This is an interesting line. Even though Nick was apparently pleased by the party that was happening, he was still looking at other’s lives and wondering what they had. Even though he had what he wanted, human curiosity caused him to look to other places for amusement. “I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.” Although Nick is inside his own party, with his own story that nobody will ever know, he is also outside of other’s lives, looking in. From what he can make out in the surrounding buildings now and throughout his life, Nick has grown to be amazed while also disgusted by the very different personalities that roam this Earth. Every person is different, but it’s crazy to think just how different everyone is.</p>

					<p>Jazz was touched on by the orchestra group playing at Gatsby’s party. Jazz was just getting popular during this time period due to the Harlem Renaissance. The Harlem Renaissance was an art movement for African Americans that brought them into the spotlight for music, poetry, art, plays and other forms of entertainment. Jazz was one of the spotlights of this movement and the spotlight for Gatsby’s party. The orchestra playing mentioned how popular the performance they were covering was and how it was in the news paper. People wanted to hear this jazz.</p>
					<p>The other historical reference in this chapter was again to the Great War. Before Nick even knew he was talking to Gatsby, they both spoke about their battalions during the war. They spoke about the villages in France (one of the battlegrounds) and the rest is blurred out in the story.</p>

					<b><i>“When the ‘Jazz History of the World’ was over girls were putting their heads on men’s shoulders in a puppyish, convivial way, girls were swooning backward playfully into men’s arms, even into groups knowing that someone would arrest their falls—but no one swooned backward on Gatsby and no French bob touched Gatsby’s shoulder and no singing quartets were formed with Gatsby’s head for one link.”</i></b>
					<p>(Author’s note: I am writing this as if I had never heard this story before, using evidence from the text thus far only.) This quote really struck me as the most interesting thing of the chapter. While some people might choose the vibrant festivities or the banter between characters, this is the part that really made me squint in confusion. I always assumed Gatsby to be kind of a shut-in, but it’s a weird man that can be alone in a crowd, never mind the fact that he organised the crowd and that it was in his house. It also mentions somewhere around this quote that while everyone else was getting piss drunk, Gatsby remained sober, watching his guests have a good time without partaking himself. These two pieces of evidence can point to a few different things off the top of my head without doing psychological research. It would appear that Gatsby is a bit depressed. To organise parties at your house, and pay your money to buy supplies, and then sit around and watch people consume your food and drink while opting to sit out of the activities, that’s the mark of someone who doesn’t love life as much as someone in his position certainly could. It is also unnatural that Gatsby would be unmarried (the quote mentions women specifically, not just partygoers), what with how rich he was and the house he lived in. In that day and age, a man like him would be snapped up instantly by women looking to marry into wealth. But I think it may be more than just not having anybody around. Maybe nobody wants to be around Gatsby? Maybe they fear him? Maybe they respect or admire him too much to get close to him? Maybe it’s the other way around, and Gatsby shies away from any friendships, perhaps even aggressively? Gatsby might want people to stay away from him. Whatever the case may be, Jay Gatsby chooses to be alone in his massive house, with only his strangely secretive assistants to be near outside of the parties.</p>

					<i>Hydroplanes</i>
					<p>During the 1920’s the Hydroplane was just starting to make its first appearances. In Chapter 4, Gatsby brought Nick onto his hydroplane in order to talk and from what it seemed like, gain trust within each other. A hydroplane is a motorboat that is designed to skim over water rather than float in water. They are typically much faster than the average boat.</p>
					<i>World Series</i>
					<p>Today, America’s favorite sport is easily football. With events like the Superbowl taking over American stores and restaurants as an entire nationwide event, there is no other sport that compares to the popularity of football. In the 1920’s football was nowhere near as popular and America’s favorite sport was baseball. Everyone was into baseball, and the World Series was comparable today to the Superbowl. The World Series was “fixed” by Meyer Wolfsheim and this is linked to an actual event in history called the “Black Box Scandal”</p>
					<i>Speakeasy</i>
					<p>A speakeasy is a place where bootleggers can buy and sell alcohol and consumers can hang out and drink. Prohibition during this time actually increased the consumption for alcohol on average, and speakeasies during this time were extremely common. The speakeasy mentioned in this chapter was when Nick was introduced to Wolfsheim by Gatsby.</p>
					<i>Wolfsheim</i>
					<p>Meyer Wolfsheim, a jewish gangster, was introduced to Nick by Gatsby. He was said to have “fixed the World Series” but not much more information was given about this man. Wolfsheim is a representation of a real gangster “Arnold Rothstein” who actually did fix the World Series in real life. Rothstein did this by paying off players of the Chicago Red Sox to lose and bet high amounts of money on the Cincinnati Reds.</p>
					<p>Rothstein made roughly $350,000 doing this and event went to trial over the entire event, which was known as “The Black Box Scandal”. Eventually, he was found to not be guilty and was let free.</p>

					<b><i>“ It’s a great advantage not to drink among hard-drinking people. You can hold your tongue and, moreover, you can time any little irregularity of your own so that everybody else is so blind that they don’t see or care.”</i></b>
					<p>This quote is one of the best I’ve done for this assignment so far, at least in my eyes. Honestly, this is one of my favorite things to do. To sit in a group of people who are not themselves or in some way impaired, while you are not, is fun, dare I use the word on an English paper. (To be fair though, this has been a lot of fun for me, to stay awake until 2:30am learning the trade of bootlegging and diagnosing fictional characters with mental illnesses while I listen to cricket sounds on YouTube.) There have been times when I’m sitting around at a friend’s house and they’re all out of their minds with sleep deprivation or whatever. You would not believe the things that people say when they don’t think anybody will remember it in a few hours. I don’t think any of them even know I know. It’s also a good way to express things you have been thinking without the responsibility of it coming back to you in the future. To have that kind of freedom around people you know is invigorating. It’s almost like doing what you want in public without society judging you. Except that’s impossible. Being the only sober (metaphorically, of course) person in a crowd gives one a sense of power, almost. The feeling that I could do anything and nobody would be able to stop me or even be any the wiser. Of course, now we’re getting into the part where these guys have to be really off their rockers, but I’m sure you get the point. There have been times when I’ve done this, sat in a crowd of drunk people, and I didn’t even know them. See a group of drunk people, push your way in, and suddenly everyone knows you from Uni or something even though I’m still in high school. That was a weird one.</p>

					<i>Women and Smoking</i>
					<br>
					<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_and_smoking">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_and_smoking</a>
					<p>Today, smoking is looked down upon for everyone. During the early 1920’s smoking was only looked down upon for women. Due to the popularity of the flapper, women were starting to have more prominent rights and one was smoking. A brand of cigarettes called “Lucky Strikes” marketed heavily towards women and even had a campaign that said “reach for a Lucky instead of a sweet.” The 1920’s were a time for women’s rights and for Gatsby to be able to light Daisy’s cigarette shows a respect that Gatsby has for her. Tom on the other hand would have probably not let her smoke or have been rude about it. These scene really shows the love that Gatsby feels for her.</p>

					<b><i>“‘Yes…. Well, I can’t talk now…. I can’t talk now, old sport…. I said a SMALL town…. He must know what a small town is…. Well, he’s no use to us if Detroit is his idea of a small town….’”</i></b>
					<p>I fear this will be another short analysis like the last one. Maybe I should go back to doing what I did in chapter 1, literally just breaking down a long quote into parts and explaining it. But here I am trying to fluff up the word count. Instead of analysing the quote directly, I’m going to use this as an example for these types of scenes in the story as a whole. Now, I don’t remember if it ever gets addressed later on in the story, and if it does, just give me a 0 for this journal because I may as well not have written it. All throughout the story, Gatsby has little scenes like these, where different cities across Eastern America call him up on his tellyphone and tell him… something or other. In my mind, this could be one of two things. Later in the story, Gatsby will try to convince Daisy to run away with him, to get far away from Tom and start over in a new life. This is one of the potential reasons for the phonecalls. Gatsby is attempting to find a small town to start a new life with Daisy in. The other possibility is more obvious, and that’s his career. Gatsby is a bootlegger, and this was around the time bootlegging was huge. but also around the time that bootlegging was beginning to be cracked down on. Maybe Gatsby doesn’t want to sell his goods in a large city anymore, for risk of being caught and taken away from Daisy, and he wants to liquidate his goods to some small town so that he can have no obligations so that he CAN GO LIVE HIS LIFE WITH DAISY BOOM CONNECTED THE TWO THEORIES. Research into this theory brings forth a lot of people agreeing with the latter idea. Case closed, locked, put a stamp on it and burn it and go home.</p>

					<b><i>“‘Can’t repeat the past?’ he cried incredulously. ‘Why of course you can!”</i></b>
					<p>God, why do I keep choosing such short quotes? This topic is great, though, Pretty sure I’ve said this before, but history is doomed to repeat itself, just like I just did twice by making a joke I’ve made before about an old saying in which I repeat history. This feels like a Dane Cook stand-up. There I go repeating history again, with another “joke”. We’ll be here all day repeating history if I look at small instances like that, though. Pretty sure I said though not too long ago. Wait.
					</p>
					<p>“Everything that needs to be said has already been said. But since no one was listening, everything must be said again.” — André Gide</p>
					<p>We’ll just take a look at some big-picture examples, mainly war related:</p>
					<p>First England, then Russia, then the U.S. attempted to invade Afghanistan and hold a position there without actually accomplishing much.</p>
					<p>Genocide. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocides_in_history">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocides_in_history</a>
					</p>
					<p>Attempting to invade Russia in the winter: Khan, Napoleon, Pasha, Hitler…</p>
					<p>Every time the stock market crashes or a depression hits, it’s “the end”. It’s not.</p>
					<p>The U.S. involvement in Afghanistan, then Yemen, then Iraq, then Pakistan, then Libya…</p>

					<i>Coupe</i>
					<p>The Coupe, mentioned multiple times throughout the Great Gatsby seems to be the only car talked about throughout the novel. A coupe is a 2-door car, popularized around the 1920’s and was the #1 manufactured type of car in this time period. Both Tom and Gatsby own a coupe.</p>
					<i>Intermarriage between black and white</i>
					<p>Interracial marriage was still a tense subject during this time. Tom, being a gigantic racist, decided to comment on the fact that he believes this is a ridiculous thing to even think of. Tom is racist throughout the book, even noting earlier on that African Americans may take over white people over time.</p>
					<i>Bootlegging over the counter drug stores</i>
					<p>Bootlegging was a common criminal activity during the 1920’s as alcohol was still under prohibition. During Chapter 7, you will learn that Gatsby was involved in bootlegging alcohol over the counter in drug stores. What this means is that the store clerk would sell alcohol over the counter if asked and Gatsby would make a profit. There are no links in history that say this was a common way of bootlegging alcohol, but it sure is a creative one from F. Scott Fitzgerald. Common places to consume alcohol included homes and speakeasies.</p>
					<p>A Speakeasy is a place named after people on the inside “speaking quietly” to conceal the fact the fact that they are consuming alcohol.</p>

					<b><i>“‘No … I just remembered that today’s my birthday.’ I was thirty. Before me stretched the portentous menacing road of a new decade.”</i></b>
					<p>This singular quote basically embodies everything that I find interesting about Nick. I have mentioned this so many times it hurts at this point, but now’s the time to nail it down. Nick Carraway, as a narrator, decides to take a backseat in the story. Sure, he is a main character, and a surprising amount of action happens because of him. But that’s just the thing- while Nick is present and a participant in many scenes, the action is happening to others, for the most part. Nick acts as a match, though. Without him, directly, a lot of things wouldn’t happen. Indirectly, the entire story wouldn’t happen. This is the most prime example of Nick filling the side lines I’ve seen. Obviously, the main conflict lies with Gatsby attempting to win back the love of Daisy. How does Gatsby accomplish this, though? He asks Nick to invite Daisy over for tea, so that the entire book can happen. Nick is the ultimate wingman. When this quote occurs, Nick has just spent his entire day, first at the Buchanan household, and then in a hotel room, mentally documenting the fights between Tom and Gatsby over Daisy. He has been intently watching and listening without speaking (along with Jordan). The others in the room are so involving and intriguing, Nick actually forgets his own birthday. Not just any birthday, either, his thirtieth. Not only is this a decade marker, it’s considered the single most important decade marker in one’s (fourth person) life. Everyone looks at this as the time that people really “grow up”. The young adult age is over, time to be a real adult. To forget something like this, Nick has to be so invested in observing this story for retelling later, he literally doesn’t know what day it is.</p>

					<i>Telephone</i>
					<p>During the 1920’s one of the most impressive technologies available was the telephone. Today, modern phone come in a single piece that features the speaker and microphone to talk over as well as feature wireless calling. However, 90 years ago this type of technology was not available and the most popular type of phone was the Candlestick telephone. This phone features two pieces, a transmitter (otherwise known as your microphone) and a receiver (otherwise known as the speaker). These Candlestick telephones are featured in the Great Gatsby, but not specifically mentioned throughout the chapter although characters are seen using the telephone.</p>

					<b><i>“‘God sees everything,’ repeated Wilson. ‘That’s an advertisement,’ Michaelis assured him.”</i></b>
					<p>Bereavement does funny things to people, mentally. When someone dear to the feelings dies, the brain goes into a state of suspension, almost. Moods drop, obviously, but there can also be other problems. One can start forgetting things they’ve seen or have trouble seeing things at all. The things they can see can be hard to understand or ingest. The poor conditions can even spread down to other bodily functions, such as regulation of blood flow from the heart, problems with the digestive system, or even troubles breathing. Bereavement can lead to sadness, depression, or, oddly, chronic preoccupation (poor concentration and trouble accomplishing things). Wilson is having trouble with at least one of these, in a constant state of rocking in a chair and crying to himself. He looks to the eyes of Eckleburg as God, insisting that they can see all, and they’ll help him find Myrtle’s killer. Maybe they can, as well, seeing that Wilson knew where Gatsby lived within just a few short hours. This is when we see the effects of grief striking Wilson so hard that he sets out to kill another and then himself just because of it.

				<i>Funeral Practices</i>
				<p>In chapter 9 of The Great Gatsby, Jay Gatsby’s memorial service is being held after he dies at the end of chapter 8. The actual processes of his funeral are not explored in too much depth, because the chapter is mainly people avoiding said funeral and Nick quitting his day job to be a philosopher. During this time period, funerals moved away from in-home services held by family members, instead becoming a profession for others. The National Funeral Directors Association worked to make funerals a tad easier on the families of the recently deceased. Cremation became more common, as spaces to bury bodies became rarer. Funeral ceremonies became more popular (or memorial service, if you were an unlucky bastard), with more than just the immediate family present to celebrate the life and mourn the death of the victim. And, of course, funerals were becoming a paid commodity, and a business venture for those brave enough.</p>

				<b><i>“That’s my middle west—not the wheat or the prairies or the lost Swede towns but the thrilling, returning trains of my youth and the street lamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly wreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow. I am part of that, a little solemn with the feel of those long winters, a little complacent from growing up in the Carraway house in a city where dwellings are still called through decades by a family’s name. I see now that this has been a story of the West, after all—Tom and Gatsby, Daisy and Jordan and I, were all Westerners, and perhaps we possessed some deficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life.”</i></b>
				<p>This story makes a fairly large deal over the difference between “New Money” and “Old Money”. By the end of the story, all the new money relationships have ended, Nick and Jordan, Gatsby and Daisy, Tom and Myrtle. But what remains? Old money- Tom and Daisy are back together and moving away. It feels like Fitzgerald has a lot to say about the young, reckless generation, spending their newly-earned money on extravagant parties and shirts. By the end of the story, being a headstrong youngin, blowing his money to get closer to Daisy got Gatsby killed. Nick realises this, that the wealth and power hungry state that New York is in in this time period was very unfitting to all of these Westerners. The East was for boring people who became rich by being from a rich family, and the West was for fools that may have had more spirit, but didn’t have as much wealth or common values. People who lived on the East coast in places like New York looked at the people of the West like Neanderthals, while the people of the West looked on to the people of the East as stuck-up snobs who couldn’t put in an honest day’s work to save their lives. Both sides were generally wrong. But here, the entire main cast of people were so far out of their element that they all either died, moved away, or were unmentioned after they hung up with Nick while he was at work. Even Nick himself moved back to the Midwest because he couldn’t stand living in New York anymore. So, to round off  this entire project: “New Money” lived too fast and recklessly in this time period for its own good, just like this time period as a whole did.</p>
